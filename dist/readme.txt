[b]Cotton Candy[/b]

[b]Overview:[/b]
Candy is a light pastel theme, hinting at cotton candy being spun.  Suitable for anime, cartoon, or similar light-hearted themes.  Or sites featuring serial killers.

This theme is built up from the 2.1 Curve2 theme, with several features added for flexibility.

The goal is to provide a single very flexible, usable and feature-rich theme.  A theme that is usable right out of the box - no need to even build a custom banner, it dynamically builds one for you.

This theme is, in part, a demo.  Theme designers should feel free to borrow code & ideas.  It is very straightforward to copy these features over to any theme.

[b]Features:[/b]
[list][li]Background animations.  A simple framework is provided for animations.[/li]
[li]Simplified yet flexible color palette.  The forum's entire palette of colors may be updated on the Current Theme admin screen.[/li]
[li]Even the colors for checkboxes and radio buttons are under user control.  Including their backgrounds...  No more blinding white squares on dark themes...[/li]
[li]Real-time color updates.[/li]
[li]SVG graphics can use style elements from the theme.  E.g., the hamburger icon is dynamically colored to match your palette.[/li]
[li]Dynamically built SVG forum banners, guaranteed to match your forum color scheme.[/li]
[li]Color palette is automatically propagated down into the sceditor as well.[/li][/list]
